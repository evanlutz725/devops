#nginx config file for docker containers on internal docker network for ctf1.cbr.quest with an nginx rp and a badstore conainer image
#can be found at the FQDN ctf1.cbr.quest
#hosted on DO droplet
#todo: add other ctf containers wtih their own FQDNs

#key takeaway - docker wouldn't resolve interanl IP on the nginx startup from the config file
#after many hours of struggling, the fix ended up being adding the upstream section and allocating shared memory for DNS
#badstore container is joined to the same interanl docker ctf_network network
